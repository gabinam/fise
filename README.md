## 🔥 What is FISE?

**FISE is a keyless, rule‑based, high‑performance _semantic envelope_ for protecting the _meaning_ of API responses and frontend data.**

- **Not a replacement** for AES, TLS, or authentication/authorization.  
- Built for **web response protection**, where traditional crypto is heavy _or_ requires exposing static keys in the frontend.
- Focused on:
  - ⚡ high‑speed transformations
  - 🧩 rule‑based semantic obfuscation
  - ♾️ infinite customization & rotation
  - 🔀 zero shared format across apps

> Calibrated claim: there is **no protocol‑level universal decoder** across FISE deployments. Attackers must tailor a decoder **per pipeline**, and rotation increases their maintenance cost.

## ⚡ Performance

See detailed benchmarks and methodology in [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](./docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

## 🔐 The True Strength of FISE: Infinite Customization, Zero Standard Format

FISE does **not** rely on a single encryption scheme. Its strength comes from **unpredictability** and **per‑application uniqueness**.

Each implementation can be entirely different:

- no fixed envelope format  
- no universal salt position  
- no predictable metadata  
- no shared offset rule  
- no constant cipher  
- no standard scanning method  
- no global structure  

**Every website/app becomes its own _encryption dialect_.**

You can customize:

- salt generation  
- salt placement (front, end, interleave, fragmented)  
- timestamp‑based entropy  
- metadata encoding (base36, base62, emoji, hex, XOR, zero‑width)  
- metadata size  
- offset rules  
- scanning patterns (charCodeAt, primes, XOR signature)  
- optional ciphers (AES, XOR, hybrid/WASM)  
- envelope assembly strategy  
- decoy/noise injection  

The customization space is **effectively infinite** → two apps almost never share the same pipeline.

**This yields practical security properties:**

- ❌ **No protocol‑level universal decoder**  
- 🔒 Reverse‑engineering one FISE target does **not** help decode another  
- 🧩 No fixed patterns  
- 🔄 Rules can rotate or regenerate instantly  
- 🎭 Security comes from **diversity**, not secrecy  

> FISE turns every app into a **unique encryption language**.

## 🏎️ Streaming & Parallel Pipelines (v1.0)

FISE supports **chunked, block‑local pipelines** that **encode/decode in parallel** and let clients start rendering **before** the full payload arrives.

- **Framed mode**: super‑header + per‑chunk metadata (bindings, offsets).  
- **Per‑chunk rotation/binding** + optional **server‑side HMAC** → higher attacker maintenance cost.  
- Works with HTTP chunked/fetch streaming/Web Workers/JSI/WASM threads.

See whitepaper §4.7, §6.7, §8.3, §9.4.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install fise
# or
pnpm add fise
# or
yarn add fise
```

---

## 🚀 Basic Usage

```ts
import { encryptFise, decryptFise, xorCipher, defaultRules } from "fise";

// Encrypt
const plaintext = "Hello, world!";
const encrypted = encryptFise(plaintext, xorCipher, defaultRules);

// Decrypt
const decrypted = decryptFise(encrypted, xorCipher, defaultRules);

console.log(decrypted); // "Hello, world!"
```

### With Options

```ts
import { encryptFise, decryptFise, xorCipher, defaultRules } from "fise";

// Encrypt with custom salt length and timestamp
const encrypted = encryptFise(
  JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
  xorCipher,
  defaultRules,
  {
    minSaltLength: 15,
    maxSaltLength: 25,
    timestampMinutes: 12345
  }
);

// Decrypt (timestamp must match)
const decrypted = decryptFise(
  encrypted,
  xorCipher,
  defaultRules,
  { timestampMinutes: 12345 }
);

console.log(JSON.parse(decrypted)); // { hello: "world" }
```

> Server‑side may add **HMAC verification** on metadata (key stays on server) to reject tamper/replay. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

A FISE transformation pipeline includes:

1. Salt generation (CSPRNG recommended)  
2. Metadata encoding (base36/62, emoji, zero‑width, etc.)  
3. Optional cipher layer (e.g., XOR/AES/WASM)  
4. Offset calculation (timestamp, primes, checksums, bindings)  
5. Envelope assembly & decoy insertion  
6. Final packed string  

Every stage is customizable; **rotation** is strongly recommended.

## 🛡 Security Philosophy

FISE is *not* AES.  
FISE is *not* a replacement for secret‑grade encryption.  

It is a **semantic protection layer** built for:

- anti‑scraping  
- data obfuscation  
- protecting curated datasets  
- raising attacker cost  
- avoiding universal decoders  
- preventing naive dataset cloning

## 🌱 The Future Direction of FISE (Rule Ecosystem)

FISE is not just a library — it is evolving into a **platform** for creating, sharing, and generating rule‑based pipelines.

### 🧩 Community Rule Ecosystem (Planned)

Developers will be able to publish:

- lightweight rule‑sets  
- high‑entropy rule‑sets  
- emoji‑channel metadata rules  
- zero‑width metadata encoders  
- timestamp‑derived offset models  
- AES/XOR hybrid pipelines  
- WASM‑optimized rules  

Each application can choose or combine multiple rule packs → accelerating diversity.  
This **reduces cross‑target reuse**, making universal attacks across apps impractical.

### 🎨 Rule Builder (Upcoming)

A **visual rule builder** will allow developers to design custom pipelines without security expertise:

- choose salt generator  
- build metadata channels  
- define offsets  
- optionally add cipher stages  
- add rotation sets  
- preview final envelope shape  

The builder will generate:

- `encode()` server function  
- `decode()` client function  
- TypeScript typings  
- tests  
- performance hints  
- HMAC validation helpers  

Anyone can build a full FISE pipeline — **no crypto expertise required**.

### 🤖 AI‑Generated Custom Rules

Because FISE pipelines have vast variability, rule‑sets can be **generated by AI** safely:

- describe your requirements (speed, entropy, CDN safety, rotation frequency)  
- AI outputs a **unique** rule‑set  
- no two AI‑generated pipelines need to be alike  

FISE becomes stronger as the ecosystem grows.

### 🌐 Community Rule Index (Future)

We plan to maintain a public rule index:

- curated, well‑tested rules  
- experimental research rules  
- normalization‑resistant channels  
- multi‑layer offset packs  
- WASM fast‑path pipelines  

Each rule pack will include:

- encode/decode implementation  
- documentation  
- performance metrics  
- CDN/Unicode normalization safety  
- tests  
- security considerations
