# FISE Whitepaper (v1.0)

**Fast Internet Secure Extensible — a rule-based, keyless, high-performance _semantic envelope_ for Web/API data**

> **Positioning (TL;DR)**  
> FISE is **not cryptography** and does not replace TLS/AuthZ. It is a **semantic obfuscation layer** that raises the *cost and time* of scraping and reverse-engineering client-visible data, while keeping runtime overhead extremely low.

---

## Abstract

Modern web apps must render meaningful JSON on the client. HTTPS protects transport, but **data meaning** remains exposed in the browser, making large-scale scraping and cloning cheap. Traditional client-side encryption requires keys in the frontend, which attackers can read; heavy crypto also adds latency.

**FISE** proposes a **rule-based, keyless transformation pipeline** that “wraps” responses in a polymorphic **semantic envelope**. Each application (and optionally each session/request) uses a unique, rotating rule-set to assemble salt, offsets, and metadata into a structure with **no protocol-level universal decoder**—attackers must tailor a decoder per pipeline. FISE focuses on *raising attacker cost* (not secrecy), with **microsecond-level** encode/decode on commodity devices.

FISE complements, not replaces: TLS, authentication/authorization, backend rate-limits, or cryptography for secrets. It is best suited where **data itself is the asset** (e.g., curated POI, pricing, recommendations, AI metadata).

FISE also supports **chunked, block-local pipelines** that enable **parallel encode/decode and streaming**, allowing clients to begin rendering **before** the full payload arrives.

---

## 1. Introduction

REST/GraphQL APIs commonly return plaintext JSON. Despite TLS, the browser must see readable data, enabling:

- automated scraping
- competitive data harvesting / dataset cloning
- inference of business logic from response shapes
- unauthorized third-party reuse

**Goal**: protect **semantic meaning** without frontend keys or heavy crypto, by **diversifying and rotating** a lightweight envelope that is cheap to run but expensive to reverse for each target.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Client visibility is inherent
Even with HTTPS:
- DevTools exposes plaintext JSON.
- Headless browsers can fetch like any user.
- Response schemas leak domain logic.

### 2.2 Why traditional crypto under-delivers on the client
- **Keys must reside in the frontend** → discoverable.
- **Operational cost** per request (key derivation/expansion, AEAD) is non-trivial on low-end clients.
- Resulting ciphertext still needs **client-side decryption** → plaintext inevitably appears in memory/DOM.

### 2.3 Scraping today is cheap
A few fetch calls and pagination often suffice to replicate valuable datasets at scale, creating **business risk** wherever data is the moat.

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

1. **Keyless by design** — no static client key to steal.  
2. **Security through diversity** — each app/session/request may use a different rule-set.  
3. **Infinite customization** — salts, offsets, metadata channels, ciphers (optional), assembly strategies.  
4. **Semantic obfuscation** — protect *meaning*, not transport.  
5. **Cheap to run, costly to reverse** — microsecond-level ops; no universal, protocol-level decoder.  
6. **Streaming & Parallel-ready** — rules can be designed block-local, enabling **per-chunk** encode/decode and multi-core execution.

---

## 4. The FISE Transformation Pipeline

A concrete deployment chooses and **rotates** among multiple rule-sets. A typical encode flow:

### 4.1 Salt & Entropy
- Variable-length salt (10–99 chars or app-defined).  
- Entropy sources: CSPRNG (preferred), timestamp mixes, rolling checksums.  
- **Recommendation**: use server-side CSPRNG to avoid predictability.

### 4.2 Metadata Encoding
Encode salt length, offsets, rule-set id, optional request/session binding tags via one or more channels:
- base36/base62/hex
- emoji lanes
- zero-width characters
- XOR signatures / parity bits

### 4.3 Optional Cipher Layer
- XOR or AES/WASM stage is **optional** to balance performance vs. resilience.  
- If used, it **does not rely on a client secret** for security claims; it only raises effort.

### 4.4 Offset Calculation
Offsets decide where to place metadata, salt, and decoy. They may derive from:
- rule-set id
- timestamp buckets
- prime sequences / rolling checksums
- request/session bindings

### 4.5 Envelope Assembly
Interleave (data + salt + metadata [+ decoy]) into a **non-deterministic**, non-fixed format.

### 4.6 Final Output
A string/byte stream with **no fixed structure** shared across deployments. There is **no protocol-level universal decoder**; decoding requires the **matching rule-set**.

### 4.7 Streaming/Framed Mode (optional)
- Payload is split into **chunks**; each chunk carries **local metadata** (rule id, offsets) and optional **HMAC bindings** (server-side verify).  
- Interleave/drift parameters derive from **(ruleset, chunkIndex, bindings)** → **no global dependency**, so chunks can be **encoded/decoded in parallel**.  
- A **super-header** specifies framing (`version`, `nChunks`, `flags`).

---

## 5. Decoding

Given a matching rule-set:
1. Extract/locate metadata via channel heuristics.  
2. Recover salt length & offsets; validate request/session bindings.  
3. Remove salt/decoy; unwind transformations.  
4. Reverse optional cipher stage.  
5. Restore plaintext JSON for rendering.

> **Framed mode.** The client may **decode chunk-by-chunk** (possibly in parallel workers) and **incrementally render** while the stream is arriving. If a rule needs cross-chunk state, carry a **small deterministic state** between chunks.

---

## 6. Security Model

### 6.1 What FISE mitigates
- Commodity scrapers relying on stable, predictable JSON.  
- Universal or reusable decoders across many targets.  
- Blind replay/tamper (when **server verification** is enabled).  
- Rapid cloning of curated datasets (cost ↑).

### 6.2 What FISE does **not** replace
- TLS (transport), authentication/authorization, access control.  
- Backend bot controls (rate limit, behavior scoring).  
- Cryptography for secrets/PII.  
- DRM-like guarantees.

### 6.3 Attacker-in-the-browser (AitB)
Attackers can run your app, hook decode functions, or dump plaintext **after** decode. FISE **cannot prevent** post-decode access; it **raises the effort** to reach and sustain that point, especially under rotation and validation.

### 6.4 Replay & Tamper (recommended hardening)
- **Request/Session binding**: include a hash of `(method|path|query|sessionId|tsBucket)` in metadata.  
- **Server-side verification**: HMAC (server key only) covering metadata & bindings to reject altered or stale envelopes.  
- **Short-lived validity**: timestamp buckets + skew windows.

### 6.5 Normalization resistance
- Design channels that survive gzip, Unicode normalization, and CDN transformations.  
- Multi-channel redundancy to tolerate lossy intermediaries.

### 6.6 Rotation
- **Per-session** or **per-request** rule-set rotation drastically increases reverse-engineering cost and decoder maintenance.

### 6.7 Framed-mode Integrity
- **Anti-reorder/tamper**: per-chunk **HMAC(meta \|\| chunkIndex \|\| bindings)** (server key only).  
- **Anti-replay**: include request/session bindings and **timestamp buckets** in each chunk’s meta.  
- **Boundary hiding**: optional decoy/padding and variable chunk sizes.

> **Claim wording**: We do **not** claim “impossible to decode.” We claim **no protocol-level universal decoder**, and **significant per-target cost** under rotation, validation, and normalization-resistant channels.

## 8. Performance

### 8.1 Microbenchmarks (illustrative)
- **Encode**: ~0.02–0.04 ms  
- **Decode**: ~0.01–0.02 ms  
- Optional AES/WASM stage: add 0.1–0.3 ms typical

### 8.2 Methodology (to report in evaluations)
- Payload sizes: 1 KB, 10 KB, 50 KB.  
- Environments: Desktop (M-series), Android mid-range, iOS mid-range.  
- Report **mean, stdev, P95/P99**.  
- Measure **end-to-end** impact (server encode → client decode → render).

### 8.3 Parallel & Streaming Benchmarks
Report **TTFR** (time-to-first-render) and **throughput** with N workers (server Node workers; client Web Workers/WASM). Typical chunk sizes: **8–32 KB**. Compare streaming vs. non-streaming P95/P99.

---

## 9. Deployment Guidance

### 9.1 Minimal (Lean) Profile
- Server: encode + HMAC verify endpoints.  
- Client: JS/RN decode runtime.  
- Rotation: 2–4 rule-sets, per-session selector.  
- Bindings: method/path/query + sessionId + timestamp bucket.  
- Bot controls: rate limits, light CAPTCHA/Turnstile where appropriate.

### 9.2 Normalization & CDN
- Validate channels across gzip/brotli, Unicode NFC/NFKC, proxies/CDN.  
- Provide fallback multi-channel metadata if a lane is stripped.

### 9.3 Observability
- Log P50/P95 encode/decode, failure reasons, suspected tamper, rotation distribution.  
- A/B toggles to quantify real-world scraping reduction.

### 9.4 When to Use Framed Mode
- Enable for payloads **≥ 100–200 KB** or when using optional WASM/cipher stages.  
- Keep rules **block-local** (or carry **tiny state**) to preserve parallel decode.  
- Validate against **Normalization Gauntlet** (gzip/brotli, Unicode NFC/NFKC, CDN).

---

## 10. Use Cases

- Web/API response protection where **data is the product**: POI/travel, pricing, recommendations, AI metadata.  
- Admin dashboards/mobile apps exposing sensitive analytics (non-secret).  
- Aggregation portals (news/content) reducing bulk harvesting.

**Not recommended** for secrets/PII/keys—use standard cryptography and access control.

---

## 11. Evaluation & KPIs

- **Scraping reduction** (A/B): drop in effective scraper throughput (target ≥ 50–70%).  
- **Time-to-decoder** for red-team per rule-set (target ≥ 5× vs. baseline).  
- Decoder breakage rate under **rotation** (maintenance cost for attacker).  
- Client overhead P95 < 1 ms on mid-range devices for ≤10 KB payloads.

---

## 12. Future Work

- Multi-block interleaving & decoy noise segments.  
- Per-request **rule-set rotation** with server seed.  
- Browser-optimized **WASM fast path**.  
- DSL & **codegen** for polymorphic-by-build pipelines.  
- Watermarking/attribution bits for leak tracing.  
- Tamper detectors and heuristic anti-hook signals.

---

## 13. Conclusion

FISE reframes client-side protection as a **semantic, rule-based envelope**: keyless, rotating, and cheap to run. It **does not prevent** post-decode access, but it **raises attacker cost** substantially by eliminating a protocol-level universal decoder and coupling data to diversified, validated rule-sets. Used alongside TLS/AuthZ, rate-limits, and behavior defenses, FISE provides **practical defense-in-depth** for teams—especially small teams—whose competitive edge lies in the data they deliver to clients.

## 14. FISE Ecosystem: DSL, Rule VM, Registry & Builder  _(v1.0)_

This section defines a path to unlock **community-driven rule diversity** and safe, deterministic execution.

### 14.1 Goals
- **Rule Diversity at Scale**: countless pipelines from community & vendors without breaking safety or DX.
- **Deterministic Runtime**: same input + same bindings → same output; budgeted CPU/memory/time.
- **Programmability**: a **DSL** that compiles to **JS/WASM** for speed and polymorphic-by-build distribution.
- **Trust & Quality**: **Registry** with CI, property tests, normalization gauntlet, and reputation scoring.
- **No Secrets in Client**: binding and rotation **do not expose** server keys; HMAC verification remains server-only.

### 14.2 FISE DSL — v0.1 (Minimum Spec)
A compact, declarative language describing **encode/decode pipelines**.

**Design Principles**
- **Declarative** operators; no arbitrary IO/network/DOM access.
- **Deterministic** evaluation; pseudo-randomness only via exposed bindings/seed.
- **Budgeted** execution: `max_ops`, `max_ms`, `max_bytes` enforced by VM.
- **Symmetry**: every encode op has a defined decode inverse (or is a no-op at decode point).

**YAML Schema (illustrative)**
```yaml
version: 1
name: "interleave-emoji-A1"
ruleset_id: "A1"
budget: { max_ops: 1000000, max_ms: 2, max_bytes: 131072 }
seed:
  source: "server-seed|csprng|timestamp-bucket"
  allow_client_variation: false
binding:
  include: ["method", "pathHash", "sessionHash", "tsBucket"]
meta:
  channels:
    - { id: "meta62", format: "base62", include: ["ruleset_id","salt.len","binding.*"] }
pipeline:
  - op: "data.stringify"   # ensure JSON string
  - op: "entropy.salt"     # produce salt with {len:{min,max}, charset:"base64url"}
    args: { len: { min: 12, max: 28 }, charset: "base64url" }
    out: "salt1"
  - op: "meta.pack"
    args: { from: ["ruleset_id","binding.*","salt1.len"], to: "meta62" }
  - op: "data.interleave"
    args: { step: 3, salt: "$salt1", drift: "codeParity%3" }
    in: "input"  # JSON string
    out: "stage1"
  - op: "meta.embed"
    args: { meta: "$meta62", channel: "emoji", spread: "prime(7)" }
    in: "stage1"
    out: "stage2"
  - op: "emit"
    args: { tag: "FISE1", meta: "$meta62", payload: "$stage2" }
```

**Core Operators v0.1**
- `data.stringify`, `data.parse`
- `data.interleave(step, salt, drift)` / `data.deinterleave(step, drift)`
- `data.scatter(map)`, `data.blockShuffle(seed)`
- `entropy.salt(len, charset)`
- `meta.pack(format, include)`, `meta.unpack`
- `meta.embed(channel, spread)`, `meta.extract(channel)`
- `codec.xor(keyless)`, `codec.aes(optional)` *(encode-side only; decode requires symmetric config but not client secrets)*
- `emit(tag, metaRef, payloadRef)` / `read(tag)`

**Bindings (read-only)**
- `method`, `path`, `pathHash`, `queryHash`, `sessionHash`, `tsBucket`, `ruleset_id`, optional `serverSeedId`
- **No** secrets; just identifiers/hashes enabling request/session binding.

**Validation Rules**
- Encode→Decode **property test** must hold (`decode(encode(x)) == x`) for random `x`.
- Budget must pass; non-deterministic ops are rejected.
- Normalization Gauntlet score ≥ policy threshold.

### 14.3 Rule VM (Sandbox Runtime)
- **Isolation**: no DOM, no network/FS; limited memory; timeouts; op-count quotas.
- **Determinism**: frozen builtins; seeded PRNG derived from allowed bindings/seed only.
- **Backends**: JS interpreter first; **WASM** JIT for fast path (optional).
- **Instrumentation**: metrics (ops, ms, bytes), decode failures, normalization outcomes.

### 14.4 Registry (Open, with CI)
- **Metadata**: name, author, semver, ops used, budget, **Gauntlet score**, P95 decode, payload delta.
- **CI Checks**: linter, schema validate, property tests, fuzz, budget/time limit.
- **Signatures**: rule packages signed (supply-chain integrity).
- **Reputation**: usage telemetry (opt-in, anonymized), field failure rates, attacker breakage reports.
- **Tags**: `mobile-fast`, `normalization-hard`, `emoji-free`, `zero-width-lite`, `wasm-fast`, `framed`.

### 14.5 Normalization Gauntlet
Automated suite to stress channels and layout:
- **Compression**: gzip/brotli.
- **Unicode**: NFC/NFKC normalization.
- **Proxy/CDN**: header munging, whitespace squeeze, minify-like transforms.
- **Transport quirks**: \\r\\n normalization, chunked boundaries.
- **Score**: aggregate survival metrics + integrity checks; published in Registry.

### 14.6 Rule Builder (UI + AI)
- **Block Editor**: drag/drop operators; live preview encode/decode on sample JSON.
- **Constraints**: budget sliders, mobile target (P95 ms), allowed channels.
- **Gauntlet in the loop**: run and show score immediately.
- **AI Copilot**: prompt to generate variants under constraints (*e.g.*, “+10% gauntlet score, P95 < 1 ms”).
- **Export Artifacts**: `ruleset.fise.yml`, generated JS/WASM, checksums, Registry manifest.

### 14.7 Distribution & Rotation
- **Polymorphic-by-build**: code generator emits different concrete code per build.
- **Rotation Policies**: per-session/per-request; server selects `ruleset_id` (no secrets).
- **Fallback**: multi-channel metadata; decode can attempt multiple lanes.

### 14.8 Governance
- **Policy Docs**: naming, claims (no crypto-replacement), disclosure of limits (Attacker-in-the-browser).
- **Reviewers**: security + performance maintainers.
- **Bounties**: reward high Gauntlet/real-world fitness; hall-of-fame & disclosure program.

### 14.9 Roadmap (Ecosystem)
- v0.2: JS VM + Registry alpha; Gauntlet CLI; 10 curated rules.
- v0.3: WASM fast-path; AI rule-mutation loop; telemetry-backed fitness.
- v1.0: Rule Builder stable; signed packages; enterprise rotation policies.

### 14.10 FISE-Framed Profile
A standard profile for chunked streaming: header (`version`, `ruleset`, `nChunks`), per-chunk meta (bindings, offsets, HMAC), recommended chunk sizes, and **Registry tags**: `framed`, `streaming-ready`, `mobile-fast`.

> **Takeaway**: The ecosystem turns FISE from a library into a **platform**—safe programmability, verifiable quality, and community-driven diversity without exposing secrets on the client.
