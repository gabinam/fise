# FISE Whitepaper (v1.0)

**Fast Internet Secure Extensible — a rule-based, keyless, high-performance _semantic envelope_ for Web/API data**

> **Positioning (TL;DR)**  
> FISE is **not cryptography** and does not replace TLS/AuthZ. It is a **semantic obfuscation layer** that raises the *cost and time* of scraping and reverse-engineering client-visible data, while keeping runtime overhead extremely low.

---

## Abstract

Modern web apps must render meaningful JSON on the client. HTTPS protects transport, but **data meaning** remains exposed in the browser, making large-scale scraping and cloning cheap. Traditional client-side encryption requires keys in the frontend, which attackers can read; heavy crypto also adds latency.

**FISE** proposes a **rule-based, keyless transformation pipeline** that “wraps” responses in a polymorphic **semantic envelope**. Each application (and optionally each session/request) uses a unique, rotating rule-set to assemble salt, offsets, and metadata into a structure with **no protocol-level universal decoder**—attackers must tailor a decoder per pipeline. FISE focuses on *raising attacker cost* (not secrecy), with **microsecond-level** encode/decode on commodity devices.

FISE complements, not replaces: TLS, authentication/authorization, backend rate-limits, or cryptography for secrets. It is best suited where **data itself is the asset** (e.g., curated POI, pricing, recommendations, AI metadata).

FISE supports **chunked, block-local pipelines** that enable **parallel encode/decode and streaming**, allowing clients to begin rendering **before** the full payload arrives. It generalizes to **media** (images/video) via framed, chunked pipelines that preserve codec/container compatibility while enabling parallel unwrap on the client. FISE further supports **per-session, server-injected rules**, avoiding static bundles and reducing reuse value of a captured decoder.

## 1. Introduction

REST/GraphQL APIs commonly return plaintext JSON. Despite TLS, the browser must see readable data, enabling:

- automated scraping
- competitive data harvesting / dataset cloning
- inference of business logic from response shapes
- unauthorized third-party reuse

**Goal**: protect **semantic meaning** without frontend keys or heavy crypto, by **diversifying and rotating** a lightweight envelope that is cheap to run but expensive to reverse for each target.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Client visibility is inherent
Even with HTTPS:
- DevTools exposes plaintext JSON.
- Headless browsers can fetch like any user.
- Response schemas leak domain logic.

### 2.2 Why traditional crypto under-delivers on the client
- **Keys must reside in the frontend** → discoverable.
- **Operational cost** per request (key derivation/expansion, AEAD) is non-trivial on low-end clients.
- Resulting ciphertext still needs **client-side decryption** → plaintext inevitably appears in memory/DOM.

### 2.3 Scraping today is cheap
A few fetch calls and pagination often suffice to replicate valuable datasets at scale, creating **business risk** wherever data is the moat.

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

1. **Keyless by design** — no static client key to steal.  
2. **Security through diversity** — each app/session/request may use a different rule-set.  
3. **Infinite customization** — salts, offsets, metadata channels, ciphers (optional), assembly strategies.  
4. **Semantic obfuscation** — protect *meaning*, not transport.  
5. **Cheap to run, costly to reverse** — microsecond-level ops; no protocol-level universal decoder.  
6. **Streaming & Parallel-ready** — rules can be designed block-local, enabling **per-chunk** encode/decode and multi-core execution.  
7. **Polymorphic-by-session** — rules can be **server-injected per session**, signed and short-lived, minimizing the reuse value of static reverse-engineering artifacts.

---

## 4. The FISE Transformation Pipeline

A concrete deployment chooses and **rotates** among multiple rule-sets. A typical encode flow:

### 4.1 Salt & Entropy
- Variable-length salt (10–99 chars or app-defined).  
- Entropy sources: CSPRNG (preferred), timestamp mixes, rolling checksums.  
- **Recommendation**: use server-side CSPRNG to avoid predictability.

### 4.2 Metadata Encoding
Encode salt length, offsets, rule-set id, optional request/session binding tags via one or more channels:
- base36/base62/hex
- emoji lanes
- zero-width characters
- XOR signatures / parity bits

### 4.3 Optional Cipher Layer
- XOR or AES/WASM stage is **optional** to balance performance vs. resilience.  
- If used, it **does not rely on a client secret** for security claims; it only raises effort.

### 4.4 Offset Calculation
Offsets decide where to place metadata, salt, and decoy. They may derive from:
- rule-set id
- timestamp buckets
- prime sequences / rolling checksums
- request/session bindings

### 4.5 Envelope Assembly
Interleave (data + salt + metadata [+ decoy]) into a **non-deterministic**, non-fixed format.

### 4.6 Final Output
A string/byte stream with **no fixed structure** shared across deployments. There is **no protocol-level universal decoder**; decoding requires the **matching rule-set**.

### 4.7 Streaming/Framed Mode (optional)
- Payload is split into **chunks**; each chunk carries **local metadata** (rule id, offsets) and optional **HMAC bindings** (server-side verify).  
- Interleave/drift parameters derive from **(ruleset, chunkIndex, bindings)** → **no global dependency**, so chunks can be **encoded/decoded in parallel**.  
- A **super-header** specifies framing (`version`, `nChunks`, `flags`).

### 4.8 Heterogeneous Per‑Chunk Rules (optional)
- Each chunk MAY select a **different rule** from a bounded pool (e.g., 3–8) to increase diversity.
- Selection is **deterministic** from bindings/seed: `rule_idx = PRNG(seed, chunkIndex) mod K`.
- A **super‑header** carries a compact `rule_map`; each chunk stores `rule_idx` instead of full ids.
- Preserve **block‑local semantics** so chunks decode independently; carry only **tiny deterministic state** if required.

### 4.9 Server‑Injected Bootstrap (optional)

**Goal:** deliver a **fresh rule** per session/request without changing the long‑cached runtime.

- **Bootstrap snippet (HTML/SSR)**: server renders a tiny `<script type="module" nonce=...>` containing a compact **rule manifest** (e.g., DSL bytecode + metadata) and calls the stable **FISE runtime** to activate it.
- **Signature**: include `sig = HMAC(serverKey, bytecode || manifest || bindings)`; the runtime verifies **before** enabling the rule.
- **Bindings**: `(method|pathHash|sessionId|tsBucket)` may be embedded to tie the rule to its context.
- **Caching**: mark bootstrap **no‑store**; keep `fise-runtime.min.js` immutable and SRI‑pinned.
- **Deterministic selection**: the per‑session rule can still define **heterogeneous per‑chunk** logic (see §4.8) using a small bounded pool.

---

## 5. Decoding

Given a matching rule-set:
1. Extract/locate metadata via channel heuristics.  
2. Recover salt length & offsets; validate request/session bindings.  
3. Remove salt/decoy; unwind transformations.  
4. Reverse optional cipher stage.  
5. Restore plaintext JSON for rendering.

> **Framed mode.** The client may **decode chunk-by-chunk** (possibly in parallel workers) and **incrementally render** while the stream is arriving. If a rule needs cross-chunk state, carry a **small deterministic state** between chunks.

---

## 6. Security Model

### 6.1 What FISE mitigates
- Commodity scrapers relying on stable, predictable JSON.  
- Universal or reusable decoders across many targets.  
- Blind replay/tamper (when **server verification** is enabled).  
- Rapid cloning of curated datasets (cost ↑).

### 6.2 What FISE does **not** replace
- TLS (transport), authentication/authorization, access control.  
- Backend bot controls (rate limit, behavior scoring).  
- Cryptography for secrets/PII.  
- DRM-like guarantees.

### 6.3 Attacker-in-the-browser (AitB)
Attackers can run your app, hook decode functions, or dump plaintext **after** decode. FISE **cannot prevent** post-decode access; it **raises the effort** to reach and sustain that point, especially under rotation and validation.

### 6.4 Replay & Tamper (recommended hardening)
- **Request/Session binding**: include a hash of `(method|path|query|sessionId|tsBucket)` in metadata.  
- **Server-side verification**: HMAC (server key only) covering metadata & bindings to reject altered or stale envelopes.  
- **Short-lived validity**: timestamp buckets + skew windows.

### 6.5 Normalization resistance
- Design channels that survive gzip, Unicode normalization, and CDN transformations.  
- Multi-channel redundancy to tolerate lossy intermediaries.

### 6.6 Rotation
- **Per-session** or **per-request** rule-set rotation drastically increases reverse-engineering cost and decoder maintenance.

### 6.7 Framed-mode Integrity
- **Anti-reorder/tamper**: per-chunk **HMAC(meta \|\| chunkIndex \|\| bindings)** (server key only).  
- **Anti-replay**: include request/session bindings and **timestamp buckets** in each chunk’s meta.  
- **Boundary hiding**: optional decoy/padding and variable chunk sizes.

### 6.8 Heterogeneous Rule Pools
- Limit pool size (e.g., 3–8) to bound code/metadata overhead and improve worker/WASM cache locality.
- Include `rule_idx` and `chunkIndex` under **server HMAC** to prevent splice/reorder attacks.
- Track field reliability per `rule_idx`; rotate out rules with poor normalization fitness.

### 6.9 Server‑Injected Rules: Signature & Localized Fallout
- **Trust on first use**: the runtime **rejects** unsigned/invalid manifests; use CSP nonces to restrict inline code.
- **Localized leak**: compromise of one session’s rule has **limited reuse**; subsequent sessions rotate.
- **Replay/tamper**: include `(sessionId|tsBucket|pathHash)` in the signed fields; per‑chunk HMAC continues to guard payload integrity.

> **Claim wording**: We do **not** claim “impossible to decode.” We claim **no protocol-level universal decoder**, and **significant per-target cost** under rotation, validation, and normalization-resistant channels.

### 6.10 Bidirectional (Two‑Way) Semantic Envelope

**Goal.** Use the same per‑session rule family to protect **both directions**: server → client (response) **and** client → server (request), while keeping the hot path lightweight and parallelizable.

**What it is.** A **two‑way semantic envelope**: the server injects a signed manifest at bootstrap; responses are wrapped (encode) and requests may optionally be wrapped (encode) by the client and **unwrapped** (decode) by the other side. The rule is **keyless** and rotates per session / time bucket; integrity of envelopes is enforced by a **server‑only HMAC** over metadata/bindings (not by a client secret).

**Security properties (adjunct).**
- **Confidentiality (semantic)**: hides *meaning* from naive scraping or middleboxes; not a replacement for TLS.
- **Context binding**: envelopes are valid only under `(method|pathHash|sessionIdHash|tsBucket[|tokenHash*])`.
- **Asymmetry**: attacker time‑to‑understand >> defender time‑to‑rotate.
- **No client secret**: avoids key exposure in the browser; HMAC secrets live only on the server.

**Performance envelope.**
- Linear byte ops (O(n)), block‑local chunks, parallel decode via Workers/JSI/WASM.
- Deterministic rule selection from `(seed, chunkIndex[, tsBucket])` within a **small warmed pool (3–8)**.

**Recommended usage.**
- **Responses (default)**: wrap JSON/media segments.
- **Requests (optional)**: wrap **non‑secret** payloads (e.g., proprietary query/filters) to raise scraping cost; keep auth/CSRF unchanged.

## 8. Performance

### 8.1 Microbenchmarks (illustrative)
- **Encode**: ~0.02–0.04 ms  
- **Decode**: ~0.01–0.02 ms  
- Optional AES/WASM stage: add 0.1–0.3 ms typical

### 8.2 Methodology (to report in evaluations)
- Payload sizes: 1 KB, 10 KB, 50 KB.  
- Environments: Desktop (M-series), Android mid-range, iOS mid-range.  
- Report **mean, stdev, P95/P99**.  
- Measure **end-to-end** impact (server encode → client decode → render).

### 8.3 Parallel & Streaming Benchmarks
Report **TTFR** (time-to-first-render) and **throughput** with N workers (server Node workers; client Web Workers/WASM). Typical chunk sizes: **8–32 KB** for JSON; **128–512 KB** for media segments. Compare streaming vs. non-streaming P95/P99.

---

## 9. Deployment Guidance

### 9.1 Minimal (Lean) Profile
- Server: encode + HMAC verify endpoints.  
- Client: JS/RN decode runtime.  
- Rotation: 2–4 rule-sets, per-session selector.  
- Bindings: method/path/query + sessionId + timestamp bucket.  
- Bot controls: rate limits, light CAPTCHA/Turnstile where appropriate.

### 9.2 Normalization & CDN
- Validate channels across gzip/brotli, Unicode NFC/NFKC, proxies/CDN.  
- Provide fallback multi-channel metadata if a lane is stripped.

### 9.3 Observability
- Log P50/P95 encode/decode, failure reasons, suspected tamper, rotation distribution.  
- A/B toggles to quantify real-world scraping reduction.

### 9.4 When to Use Framed Mode
- Enable for payloads **≥ 100–200 KB** or when using optional WASM/cipher stages.  
- Keep rules **block-local** (or carry **tiny state**) to preserve parallel decode.  
- Validate against **Normalization Gauntlet** (gzip/brotli, Unicode NFC/NFKC, CDN).

### 9.5 Media‑Specific Guidance
- **Video (HLS/DASH/CMAF)**: wrap **segments**, not manifests. Bindings include variant id and timestamp buckets. Client unwraps in workers then appends raw bytes to MSE.
- **Images**: whole‑file wrap (Blob URL) or **tile‑based** wrap for deep‑zoom; avoid CDN recompression on enveloped assets.
- **CDN/Optimizer**: disable transforms (recompress/minify) on enveloped media; validate via Gauntlet.
- **Chunk sizes**: 128–512 KB per segment chunk on web; schedule workers to group identical `rule_idx` for cache locality.

### 9.6 Bootstrap Patterns (Web & RN)
- **Web (SSR/SPA)**: render a per‑session **bootstrap** with CSP nonce; load `fise-runtime.min.js` (immutable). Verify signature, then initialize workers and start framed decoding.
- **React Native**: fetch `GET /fise/rule?sid=...` for the manifest; verify signature; pass to native/JSI runtime.
- **CDN**: do **not** cache the bootstrap; cache the runtime and enveloped payloads normally.

---

## 10. Use Cases

- Web/API response protection where **data is the product**: POI/travel, pricing, recommendations, AI metadata.  
- Admin dashboards/mobile apps exposing sensitive analytics (non-secret).  
- Aggregation portals (news/content) reducing bulk harvesting.
- Media delivery: **per‑segment video** (HLS/DASH/CMAF) and **image tiles/files** wrapped in FISE for anti‑bulk scraping while preserving player/decoder compatibility.

**Not recommended** for secrets/PII/keys—use standard cryptography and access control.

---

## 11. Evaluation & KPIs

- **Scraping reduction** (A/B): drop in effective scraper throughput (target ≥ 50–70%).  
- **Time-to-decoder** for red-team per rule-set (target ≥ 5× vs. baseline).  
- Decoder breakage rate under **rotation** (maintenance cost for attacker).  
- Client overhead P95 < 1 ms on mid-range devices for ≤10 KB payloads.

---

## 12. Future Work

- Multi-block interleaving & decoy noise segments.  
- Per-request **rule-set rotation** with server seed.  
- Browser-optimized **WASM fast path**.  
- DSL & **codegen** for polymorphic-by-build pipelines.  
- Watermarking/attribution bits for leak tracing.  
- Tamper detectors and heuristic anti-hook signals.

---

## 13. Conclusion

FISE reframes client-side protection as a **semantic, rule-based envelope**: keyless, rotating, and cheap to run. It **does not prevent** post-decode access, but it **raises attacker cost** substantially by eliminating a protocol-level universal decoder and coupling data to diversified, validated rule-sets. Used alongside TLS/AuthZ, rate-limits, and behavior defenses, FISE provides **practical defense-in-depth** for teams—especially small teams—whose competitive edge lies in the data they deliver to clients.

## 14. FISE Ecosystem: DSL, Rule VM, Registry & Builder

This section defines a path to unlock **community-driven rule diversity** and safe, deterministic execution.

### 14.1 Goals
- **Rule Diversity at Scale**: countless pipelines from community & vendors without breaking safety or DX.
- **Deterministic Runtime**: same input + same bindings → same output; budgeted CPU/memory/time.
- **Programmability**: a **DSL** that compiles to **JS/WASM** for speed and polymorphic-by-build distribution.
- **Trust & Quality**: **Registry** with CI, property tests, normalization gauntlet, and reputation scoring.
- **No Secrets in Client**: binding and rotation **do not expose** server keys; HMAC verification remains server-only.

### 14.2 FISE DSL — v0.1 (Minimum Spec)
- Declarative operators; no arbitrary IO/network/DOM access.  
- Deterministic evaluation; pseudo-randomness only via allowed bindings/seed.  
- Budgeted execution: `max_ops`, `max_ms`, `max_bytes`.  
- Symmetry: every encode op has a decode inverse.

### 14.3 Rule VM (Sandbox Runtime)
- Isolation: no DOM, no network/FS; limited memory; timeouts; op-count quotas.  
- Determinism: frozen builtins; seeded PRNG derived from bindings/seed only.  
- Backends: JS interpreter first; optional **WASM** fast path.  
- Instrumentation: metrics (ops, ms, bytes), decode failures, normalization outcomes.

### 14.4 Registry (Open, with CI)
- Metadata: name, author, semver, ops used, budget, **Gauntlet score**, P95 decode, payload delta.  
- CI: linter, schema validate, property tests, fuzz, budget/time.  
- Signatures: rule packages signed (supply-chain).  
- Reputation: anonymized usage telemetry (opt‑in), field failure rates, attacker breakage reports.  
- Tags: `mobile-fast`, `normalization-hard`, `emoji-free`, `zero-width-lite`, `wasm-fast`, `framed`.

### 14.5 Normalization Gauntlet
- Compression: gzip/brotli; Unicode: NFC/NFKC; Proxy/CDN quirks.  
- Score: survival metrics + integrity; published in Registry.

### 14.6 Rule Builder (UI + AI)
- Block editor; live preview; budget sliders; Gauntlet-in-the-loop.  
- AI copilot for mutation (“+10% gauntlet score, P95 < 1 ms”).  
- **Bootstrap generator**: export per‑session rule manifest (bytecode + signature fields).

### 14.7 Distribution & Rotation
- Polymorphic-by-build codegen variants; per-session/per-request rotation.  
- Fallback: multi-channel metadata; decode can attempt multiple lanes.

### 14.8 Governance
- Claims policy; disclosure of limits (AitB).  
- Reviewer roles (security/perf).  
- Bounties/hall‑of‑fame.

### 14.9 Roadmap (Ecosystem)
- v0.2: JS VM + Registry alpha; Gauntlet CLI; 10 curated rules.
- v0.3: WASM fast path; AI mutation loop; telemetry-backed fitness.
- v1.0: Rule Builder stable; signed packages; enterprise rotation policies.

---

## 15. FISE‑Media Profile (images & video)

**Goal:** container/codec‑preserving envelopes with **parallel, chunked unwrap** on the client.

### 15.1 Segment‑Envelope (recommended)
- **Video**: apply FISE per **segment** (`.ts`, `.mp4`, CMAF). Super‑header announces `version`, `nChunks`, `rule_map`. Each chunk carries `rule_idx`, `chunkIndex`, `len`, bindings, and **HMAC(server)**.
- **Client flow**: `fetch(segment) → WebWorker.decodeFise(chunked) → appendBuffer(bytes)` (MSE). Start render as soon as first chunk is decoded.
- **Images**: wrap **entire file**; decode to `Blob` then `img.src=URL.createObjectURL(blob)`. For deep‑zoom, wrap **per‑tile** for higher parallelism and per‑tile rotation.

### 15.2 Heterogeneous per‑chunk rules
- Deterministic selection from seed/bindings; keep pool small (3–8). Optimize scheduler to batch by `rule_idx` to reduce JIT/WASM thrash.

### 15.3 Integrity & Anti‑replay
- Include `(rule_idx || chunkIndex || len || bindings)` in **HMAC** (server key only). Bindings cover `method|path|variant|tsBucket`.
- Optional decoy/padding and variable chunk sizes to hide internal boundaries.

### 15.4 Compatibility & Gauntlet
- Validate against gzip/brotli, Unicode normalization, proxy/CDN mutations, and platform image/video pipelines.
- Disallow CDN recompression on enveloped assets; publish Gauntlet score in Registry metadata.

### 15.5 Metrics
- **TTFR** improvement vs. baseline, **throughput** with N workers, **P95/P99** decode, **decoder breakage rate** under rotation.

### 15.6 Critical‑Fragment Obfuscation (Selective Partial Protection)

**Idea:** obfuscate a **very small portion** (≈0.5–3% bytes) that is **structurally critical** to decoding/visual quality, then restore it client‑side in the framed pipeline. This preserves **throughput** and **parallelism** while making CDN‑level restreaming impossible without the rule.

**Video (MP4/CMAF/HLS/DASH):**  
- **Init segment**: lightly obfuscate parts of **parameter sets** (e.g., SPS/PPS for AVC/HEVC, sequence headers/OBUs for AV1).  
- **Key frames (IDR)**: obfuscate a few **tiles/macroblocks** at the start of each IDR or selected **slice header** fields.  
- **Sample description / `stsd`**: minimal perturbation that invalidates naive decoders until client restores.

**Images (JPEG/WebP/AVIF):**  
- **JPEG**: obfuscate a handful of **MCU** at scan start, or perturb **Huffman/Quant tables** with a deterministic, invertible delta.  
- **WebP/AVIF**: target a small set of **OBU/Chunk headers** or the first **tile** in each region.

**Client restoration:** performed **per‑chunk** in Web Workers/JSI/WASM (block‑local), then fed to MSE (video) or `Blob URL` (image).

**When to use:** environments you control end‑to‑end (no CDN recompression) or alongside **15.1 Segment‑Envelope** as an inner layer for high‑value routes.

**Caveats:** ensure compatibility with players; validate via **Normalization Gauntlet** and device lab before rollout.

### 15.7 Live Event Anti‑Restream Profile (optional)

**Goal:** make near‑realtime restreaming economically unviable by coupling **time‑bucket rotation** with **heterogeneous per‑chunk rules** and (optionally) **critical‑fragment obfuscation**.

**Profile:**  
1. **Per‑session bootstrap** (signed, no‑store).  
2. **Per‑segment envelope** (2–4 s segments) with `super‑header`, `rule_map`, and **HMAC(meta‖chunkIndex‖bindings)**.  
3. **Heterogeneous‑by‑chunk**: pool of 3–8 rules, selection deterministic from `(seed, chunkIndex, tsBucket)`.  
4. **Rotation by time‑bucket** (e.g., every 15–30 s).  
5. **Optional critical fragments**: touch init + IDR boundaries (≤3% bytes) to break naive playback.  
6. **Bindings**: include `(method|pathHash|variant|sessionIdHash|tsBucket)` in meta/HMAC.  
7. **Watermark (optional)**: per‑session tracers in metadata/offset layout for leak attribution.

**Outcome:** legitimate clients decode **in parallel** with low **TTFR**, while attackers accumulate **latency debt** (find bootstrap → build N decoders → track rotations), causing restreams to lag or fail.

## 16. Temporal Polymorphism & Rule Injection Diversity

Modern large‑scale scrapers rely on two assumptions: (1) the protection mechanism is **stable over time**, and (2) it is **uniform across clients**. FISE invalidates both by introducing **temporal polymorphism** and **distribution‑level variability**: the effective rule‑set for each client (and potentially each request) is **inlined at bootstrap time** and can be **mutated/rotated** with negligible operational cost. This unpredictability raises both **attack construction** and **attack maintenance** costs.

### 16.1 Client‑Side Rule Injection (Per‑Client Distribution)

On each initial HTML load, the app may embed the **effective decode rule‑set** for that session. The rule need not be static, global, or shared.

**Injection vectors (non‑exhaustive):**
- Inline `<script type="module">` with CSP nonce (short‑lived)
- External bundles (per‑build polymorphism)
- Dynamic `import()` loaders
- Service Worker bootstrap responses
- Inlined bootstrap JSON (`window.__FISE__`)
- CSS‑encoded lanes (zero‑width / emoji / base62)
- WASM modules with partial decode logic
- `<meta>`‑embedded metadata
- `Link: rel=prefetch` headers
- First‑call bootstrap API responses

Apps may **select/rotate injection paths** at runtime. Thus, even within the same ruleset family, each client can receive a **structurally different** decode pipeline.

**Implication.** There is no single reliable “place” to locate the decoder; reverse‑engineering must begin **from scratch** for each injection variant.

### 16.2 Distribution Polymorphism (Diversity Across Clients)

Since rules are injected at bootstrap, delivery can vary **per‑build**, **per‑client**, **per‑session**, and even **per‑request** (for sensitive endpoints). The rule itself may be:
- injected as a concrete pipeline,
- generated via DSL at build‑time,
- mutated by polymorphic codegen, or
- selected from a pool of community salt packs.

This yields a many‑to‑many mapping:
```
Client 1 → A₁
Client 2 → A₂
Client 3 → B₁
Client 4 → C₃
...
```
Even within the same family (A, B, C), **materialization differs** per client.

**Implication.** Attackers cannot prepare a universal, reusable decoder. At best they reverse one session, which becomes invalid after rotation.

### 16.3 Temporal Rule Rotation (Maintenance Asymmetry)

Breaking a pipeline requires:
1) locating the injected rule, 2) understanding the pipeline, 3) reconstructing a decoder, 4) validating, 5) automating. This can take hours per pipeline.

Defenders can rotate **per deployment / per session / per time bucket / per request** with near‑zero cost.

**Asymmetry.**
```
Attacker time‑to‑understand  >>  Defender time‑to‑rotate
```
Thus, even successful decoding is **short‑lived** and **non‑transferable**.

> **Claim wording:** FISE does **not** prevent decoding; it aims to ensure any successful decoding is **short‑lived and non‑reusable**.

### 16.4 Zero‑Reuse Reverse Engineering

Traditional anti‑scrape fails because one break scales: same signatures, payload formats, and schemas. FISE breaks that model:
- Decoding logic is **session‑local**.
- Pipeline structure is **instance‑specific**.
- Injection vectors are **variable**.
- Offsets/metadata lanes can differ **per request**.
- Each instance **decays quickly** under rotation.

**Result.** Reverse‑engineering may be feasible but **economically useless** beyond the original session.

**Principle:** *No protocol‑level universal decoder, no reusable exploit.*

### 16.5 Security Implications

Temporal & distribution polymorphism increase:
- attacker cost (initial & ongoing),
- attacker uncertainty,
- scraping maintenance overhead,
- difficulty of automation,
- resistance to pattern matching (including AI‑assisted).

…while maintaining:
- microsecond‑level overhead,
- no client‑side secrets,
- straightforward integration for small/medium teams.

We call this **Semantic Protection with Temporal & Distribution Polymorphism (SP‑TDP)**—a defense model where attack cost scales roughly **per client / per session**, while defense cost remains **near‑constant**.

## 17. Portability & Platform Profiles

FISE’s core is dependency‑free, linear byte/string transforms with optional WASM fast paths. This makes it portable across Web, Mobile, TV/IoT, Edge, and Native stacks. Below are **reference profiles** and packaging targets.

### 17.1 API Surface (minimal)
- `encode(input: Uint8Array, manifest: Manifest): Uint8Array`
- `decode(input: Uint8Array, manifest: Manifest): Uint8Array`
- `encodeFramed(stream, manifest): AsyncIterable<Chunk>`
- `decodeFramed(stream, manifest, { maxWorkers? }): AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>`

**Manifest (self‑contained).** `rulesetId`, `rule_map`, `seedHint`, `bindings`, `sig`, `version`.

### 17.2 Web (Browser)
- **Profiles:** `web-core` (JS), `web-wasm` (auto WASM), `media-segment-envelope`, `media-critical-fragment` (opt‑in).
- **Parallelism:** Web Workers; transferable buffers.
- **Media:** MSE append after unwrap; Image via Blob URL.
- **Notes:** CSP nonce on bootstrap; Gauntlet (gzip/brotli/NFC/NFKC/CDN).

### 17.3 Mobile (React Native)
- **Profile:** `rn-jsi` (C++/Rust core via JSI) + JS shim.
- **Parallelism:** thread pool inside JSI; avoid GC churn; preallocate buffers.
- **Media:** decode per‑chunk then pass to native players or custom renderers.

### 17.4 TV & IoT
- **Webview targets (Tizen/webOS/Android TV/kiosk):** prefer `media-segment-envelope`; Workers if available; WASM optional; fallback scalar.
- **Native set‑top/embedded:** static lib (C/C++/Rust); expose `encode/decode/decodeFramed`; 2–4 worker threads are sufficient for 2–4s segments.
- **Metadata lanes:** prefer hex/base36 over zero‑width/emoji on firmware that normalizes content.

### 17.5 Edge Runtimes (Cloudflare/Deno/Bun/Vercel Edge)
- **Profile:** ESM build, no Node APIs required; Worker pool polyfill for concurrency or single‑thread fallback.
- **Streaming:** handle `ReadableStream` with framed decode for low latency. 

### 17.6 Native (iOS/Android/Desktop)
- **iOS:** Swift Package + static C/C++/Rust core.
- **Android:** AAR (Kotlin) with JNI to C/C++ core if needed.
- **Desktop:** Rust/C++ lib, Node addons for Electron.
- **Endianness:** operate on byte arrays (endian‑agnostic).

### 17.7 Rule Budget & Compatibility
- **Budget:** ≤ 2k ops/KB; P95 JSON ≤10 KB < 1 ms on mid‑range mobile; minimal allocations.
- **Forbidden in hot path:** PBKDF, SHA‑heavy, big‑int crypto.
- **Gauntlet:** test against gzip/brotli, Unicode normalization, proxy/CDN rewrites, and media pipelines.

### 17.8 Packaging
- **Web/Node:** ESM + CJS with d.ts; optional WASM.
- **RN:** JSI module; pods/gradle config.
- **Edge:** ESM only.
- **Native:** static libs + thin adapters.

**Claim wording.** By keeping cores simple and dependency‑free, FISE can be implemented consistently across platforms while preserving performance (parallel, block‑local) and robustness (Gauntlet‑tested lanes).
